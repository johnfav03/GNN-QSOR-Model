## Description
This is my attempt at replicating a QSOR (Quantitative Structure-Odor Relationships) model from a research paper using a GCN (Graph Convolution Network). 

## Acknowledgements
* [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10685) is the basis for the model
* Both datasets are from the [Pyrfume archive](https://github.com/pyrfume/pyrfume-data)
